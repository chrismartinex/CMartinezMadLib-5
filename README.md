Peer Review: Arely martinez -- The program was fun and easy to run through. The responses really showed my more of what Chris' personality is like. The code was also very thought out. Compared to my code chrises was very condensed and simple. He also had a completly different way of doing data vaildation from others work that ive reviewed. (Overall very user friendly and easy to understand code)
